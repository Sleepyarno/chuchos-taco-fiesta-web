There are several ways of editing your application.

**Use Lovable**

Simply visit the [Lovable Project](https://lovable.dev/projects/40df2c77-02d6-4067-9680-21ffd9fcea04) and start prompting.

Changes made via Lovable will be committed automatically to this repo.

**Use your preferred IDE**

If you want to work locally using your own IDE, you can clone this repo and push changes. Pushed changes will also be reflected in Lovable.

The only requirement is having Node.js & npm installed - [install with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

Follow these steps:

```sh
# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev
```

**Edit a file directly in GitHub**

- Navigate to the desired file(s).
- Click the "Edit" button (pencil icon) at the top right of the file view.
- Make your changes and commit the changes.

**Use GitHub Codespaces**

- Navigate to the main page of your repository.
- Click on the "Code" button (green button) near the top right.
- Select the "Codespaces" tab.
- Click on "New codespace" to launch a new Codespace environment.
- Edit files directly within the Codespace and commit and push your changes once you're done.

## Important Notes on Data Storage

This application, in its current state, uses several strategies for data persistence with specific limitations:

**Text-Based Content (Menu, Contact Info, Hours, Hero, About):**
*   All textual content and configuration for these sections are stored in the browser's `localStorage`.
*   When you make changes in the Admin Panel, these changes are saved to `localStorage`.
*   If `localStorage` is empty or cleared, the application falls back to the default data provided in the JSON files within the `src/data/` directory.
*   **Limitations of `localStorage`:**
    *   **Browser-Specific:** Data is only stored in the browser where it was saved. Accessing the site from a different browser or device will not show the changes.
    *   **Storage Limits:** `localStorage` has size limitations (typically 5-10MB).
    *   **No Server Backup:** Data is not backed up and can be lost if browser data is cleared.
    *   **Manual Reset:** The "Reset to Default" button in the admin panel clears the `localStorage` data, reverting to the initial JSON defaults.

**Gallery Images:**
*   **Default Images:** The initial set of gallery images are loaded from the `public/lovable-uploads/` directory. These are part of the project's static assets.
*   **User-Uploaded Images (Admin Panel):** When you "upload" an image in the Gallery Editor:
    *   The image is **not** actually uploaded to a server.
    *   A temporary object URL (`URL.createObjectURL()`) is generated by the `src/utils/fileUploader.ts` utility. This URL allows the browser to display a preview of the selected local image.
    *   This preview is **temporary and session-specific**. If you close the browser tab or refresh the page after selecting an image but *before saving the gallery data (which stores the object URL in localStorage)*, the preview might be lost. Even when saved to localStorage, the object URL may not be valid across different browser sessions or if the original local file is moved/deleted.
    *   The path to this temporary object URL is stored in `localStorage` when you save the gallery. However, its reliability across sessions is not guaranteed.

**Recommendations for Production / Serious Use:**
For any production application or if data persistence and reliability are critical, it is **strongly recommended** to implement a proper backend solution. This would typically involve:
*   A server-side API (e.g., built with Node.js/Express, Python/Django/Flask, Ruby on Rails, etc.).
*   A database for storing text content and image metadata (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB).
*   Dedicated file/image hosting (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Cloudinary) for persistently storing uploaded images and serving them via stable URLs.
*   Updating the application to interact with this backend for all data operations instead of relying on `localStorage` and temporary object URLs.
